Such an amazing question.
Because, you know, You will never have a second chance to leave the first impression.
So this is why I'm going to answer, "I help people solve their problems."
And not because I've had just much knowledge. Moreover, definitely, not because I am an imitator or a pretender.
It is mostly because of my specific mindset.
Next, I have to say that I'm a rational person.
Also, this is not just regarding money spending as you might think and even not connected with that even the same way.
When I say rational, I mean that whenever I do something, I always try using all my background knowledge and continually asking myself many questions, "Why?".
I do that to uncover the primary cause.
From my experience, many people, despite having many years of experience, tend to make mistakes when they have been asked to pick the root cause or try to distinguish whether the claim is a cause or a consequence, or a correlation, or a coincidence.
Probably you wanna say, "Okay, we are all aware of critical thinking,"
but now I'm ready to tell you the main thing.
I put all of my efforts to remove any implicit context and any ambiguity from the claims, questions, statements, requirements, constraints, and all things shud be done right way by the hardly specified time. So finally, I'm ready to say that I'm a software engineer. Please don't be confused with a software developer. That is what I wanted to tell you about me. However, if I said I'm a software developer, I think it wouldn't be such captivating, would it?
