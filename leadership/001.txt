What -> How -> Why.

#1. How is it going -> How is life
#2. What is the latest on?... -> Can you tell me about what’s been most surprising about working on X so far?”
#3: “How can I help you?” ->  “I was thinking I’m being too hands-on on this project. Should I back off and check-in with you only bi-weekly? What do you think?
#4: “How can we improve?” -> What do you think is the most overlooked area of the business?” or “Where do you think we’re behind in, that other companies are excelling at?”
