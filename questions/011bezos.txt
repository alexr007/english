How will you use your gifts?
What choices will you make?
Will inertia be your guide, or will you follow your passions?
Will you follow dogma or be original?
Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure?
Will you wilt under criticism or follow your convictions?
Will you bluff it out when you're wrong or apologize?
Will you guard your heart against rejection or act when you fall in love?
Will you play it safe or be a bit swashbuckling?
When it's tough, will you give up or be relentless?
Will you be a cynic or a builder?
Will you be clever at the expense of others, or will you be kind?
